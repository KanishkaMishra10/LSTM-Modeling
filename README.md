# LSTM-Modeling
A forecasting model for predicting the prices of Binance coin (cryptocurrency).

Framework Used: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used: 
* Tensor Flow - LSTM modeling
* Keras
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Skylearn

* plotly
* pycoingecko - Cryptocurrency API

# Sequence of Instructions Performed

1. I have first installed/imported all the required libraries
2. Then imported the dataset into our jupyter notebook.
3. Performed Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing
4. Used Box plot to understand the distribution of the data
5. Since the data was highly skewed, log scalling was done.
6. Then, used a candelstick chart to visualize the opening, high , low, and closing prices of the binance coin.
7. Build the model.
8. Trained the model and then evaluated using testing data and various matrices.
